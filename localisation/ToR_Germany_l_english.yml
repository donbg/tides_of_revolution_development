GER_TIDES_OF_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "The new Reich has arisen. It has been four years since Dressler's Valkists secured power after winning the snap elections. The economy is thriving once again with the Valkists funneling ungodly amounts of money into the arms industry to ensure that in the upcoming wars nobody will stand up to Germany's greatness. \n\nOnly the upcoming years will decide whether Dressler's dreams remain dreams or if the Fuhrerreich will become more than the sum of its parts, with Germany being the superpower it always aspired to be."

In 1917 the radical socialists in the party were expelled and formed their own organization, the USPD. With increased support from moderates the party managed to win the general election following the war. After being forced from power during the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch the party was criminalized under the reinstated Anti-Socialist Laws. The government accused the party of fraternizing with revolutionaries from Russia and France. However their ban was rescinded in 1931 and the party has since then enjoyed moderate support among the German populace.§!"
